## Synopsis

A Rust helper crate for testing drop-semantics.

## Motivation

When implementing one's own smart pointers or collections in Rust one tends to end up having to resort to manual memory management using `std::ptr`, including manual drop management. At which point one will want to write unit tests for making sure the implementation works as one expects it to.

This is where `droptest` comes in handy!

## Usage

```rust
use droptest::prelude::*;

let registry = DropRegistry::default();
let guard = registry.new_guard();
let guard_id = guard.id();

assert_no_drop!(registry, guard_id);

std::mem::drop(guard);

assert_drop!(registry, guard_id);
```
